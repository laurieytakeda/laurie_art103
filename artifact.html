<h2>phase 2: the artifact and story: project outline - in class discussion</h2>

<div>
  <h4> Supposition: What if we interacted with computers purely with eye tracking and voice recognition.</h4>
  <ul>
    <li> engineering would be hard</li>
    <li> communication might be better or erider between people </li>
    <li> A house full of command / voice control </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div>
  <h4>Supposition: What if instead of meeting in zoom, class meeting host in virtual reality and itâ€™s playable.</h4>
  <ul>
    <li> Interacting with each other in a classroom space would be completely different. The possibility for immersion is greater but our behavior can also be more limited than in a normal classroom.
    </li>
    <li> people/students are more engaging</li>
    <li> It would be more interesting; people could customize themselves and use their imaginations to be whatever they would want to be </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div>
  <h4>Supposition: What would happen if in wars/conflict from the past instead of using swords or guns, we used pool noodles?</h4>
  <ul>
    <li> Pool noodle UN? All the countries would invest in pool noodle training </li>
    <li> Pool noodle competition for making decision (Pool Noodle Kung Fu)</li>
    <li> Another way to destress by hitting others with pool noodles lol</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<h2> phase 3: rough images and story</h2>
<div><img src="images/artifactphase3_1.JPG" width="600" height="400">
<p>This idea was brought up through the cultural aspect of fans in Asian culture. This fan would be made from flower petals to make the air/wind that's produced from the fan smell like flowers.</p>
</div>
<div>
<img src="images/artifactphase3_2.JPG" width="600" height="400">
<p>This idea came from the idea of what if stuffed animals were thought of differently than what we think of as cuddly. The teddy bear would be like a huge statue (idol) that's worshipped by people, and made from a heavier material, making it look blockier than the smaller, cuter versions of it. I guess it could be seen as something that has more value than how we perceive them to be. </p>
</div>

<h2> phase 4: rough draft of model and story sign off</h2>
<h4> link to <a href="https://a360.co/3o45c5f">fusion model</a></h4>
<p>In the year 8050, there's an art school that has started to develop all-natural structures from plants through the process of genetically engineering them to create certain things through planting, growing, cutting and grooming, instead of using heavy duty materials. Through this process, the art students are able to grow objects and shape them in different way as they continue to grow. The first experiment was with small objects; the very first being a fan. Different trees and other plants are grafted together to create stronger materials for binding and creating strong materials to enhance society. </p>
