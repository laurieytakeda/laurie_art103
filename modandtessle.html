<h2>group tesselations: team TELA</h2>
<p> As a group, we decided that the common shape would be a triangle. The triangle at the base had a curved edge which each person in the group would use as the base shape for their own shape, building upon it to create a new shape. We each added some identifiable shapes to the other sides, but they weren't super complicated so that we knew what we were working wit. For my shape, I had no idea what I was going to do, and I'm not the most skilled with Illustrator, so I opted for adding two different rectangular shapes on the left side of the triange.  </p>

<h2>phase 2 - round 1 fastener design </h2>
<p>As a group, we had decided to use kiragami as the base method for how we would come up with fastener. We all used paper to create our designs. We didn't have a set path for what each of us were going to do, other than that we wanted to use kiragami as the method for a fastener.</p>
<p> With my fastener, I chose the a triangle shape with slits that on each side of the triangle to create a modular design. At the beginning, trying to put the pieces together was hard due to some of the pieces not being the right size, but it created an object that looked similar to a soccer ball. Some of the pros are that it wasn't too hard to make that many triangles and put them together because I made them small enough to where it would work well and not be overwhelming. The con was that it looks super symmetric and I'm not sure how I would be able to place things in a different way. Another thing was that it was difficult to remember which side aligned with the other side because I would mix it up as I continued to cut the paper. </p>

<h2>phase 3 - goldilocks laser tests </h2>
<p> The approach that my group had when making these pieces was to try to make something that could connect to each other, but still have some sort of diversity to the shapes. Most of the fasteners were the same, but we had made some that were different and didn't connect with the other pieces. Each of the pieces I think we could've made some other fasteners that would've aligned differently to have more variety in the way that the pieces could (or couldn't) fit. It was interesting to see what we could come up with in a short amount of time, asnd see how the end result is.</p>
