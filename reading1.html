<h2> reading questions</h2>

<h4> 1. What is a good working definition of what a system is and isn’t?</h4>
<p> A system isn’t individual parts by itself;</p>

<h4> 2. For the 4 system definitions, you were to look up, please give in your own words what they mean and an example of each one </h4>
<p> a. Modularity - different parts within a system can have rearranged roles;
  Organisms composed of molecules</p>
<p> b. Decomposabiilty - parts can't be changed anymore, otherwise the system wouldn't work; cutting paper</p>
<p> c. Emergence - the behavior from relatively simple and similar relationships from very different parts; snowflakes</p>
<p> d. Chaos theory - systems that are sensitive to predetermined conditions with a multitude of results and still maintain the behavior in larger systems that remain balanced; Weather patterns</p>

<h4> 3. Give definition of what tessellation means and an example you encountered</h4>
<p>Tessellation - geometric pattern(s) that’s repeated without gaps or overlap
  Disneyworld’s Spaceship Earth (ride in epcot)</p>

<h4> 4. What’s the difference between ideas of modularity and tessellation? What are properties that are in opposition with each other? </h4>
<p> The difference between modularity and tessellation is that tessellations have a set pattern, whereas modularity can have a variety of configurations within the same roles.Within modularity, parts within the system can be interchangeable, while
  tessellations usually have one structure that’s consistent throughout the system.</p>

<h4> 5. What’s the difference between designing something that has complexity (aperiodic) v being uniform (periodic)?</h4>
<p>The difference between complexity and being uniform is that periodic designs can have repeated tiles in 2 different directions that have symmetry, while aperiodic designs are random.
